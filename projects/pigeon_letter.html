            <p><em>A Letter to the Fatsworth Institute, from Josephine Aldithley. Found on a homing pigeon in Rilgate.</em></p>
            <p>After countless weeks spent traveling the Reach, I am endless glad to report that I have finally arrived at Intersection, the great city built on the very edge of our world. It is a strange place, of towering, twisted sculptures and low, huddled buildings. The portion of the city that is built down the Edge (for surely the capital is justified) is stranger still, almost like abstract art describing a city. It spends more than half of each day in shadow, and windows are carefully tilted to prevent the unwary from catching a glimpse of the abyss below. …</p>
            <p>Though it has taken several days, I was able to enlist the assistance of a mason who occasionally works on the cliff-side buildings. He provided me with a crane and platform that would place me almost ten yards from the wall of the cliff, and allow an unobstructed look down towards the Core below us. We are waiting for a lull in the flow of magic to embark on the experiment. …</p>
            <p>[The writing grows noticeably shaky at this point]</p>
            <p>The first attempt was entirely unsuccessful. As I peered down over the edge of the platform, I saw the cliff stretching away into nothingness and then the nothingness itself. It was as if my eyes simply were not able to see what lies beneath - much like the auras of the migraines that I still occasionally suffer. While I was recording my observations (you will find copies attached to this missive) the flow of magic from the core increased.</p>
            <p>I find it hard to write of this, but I will do my best to remain objective.</p>
            <p>My companion, Ayre Shanelis, gave a shout of delight and dove from the platform towards the Core. At the same time, the substance of the crane animated, twisting itself into a flock of long-necked birds with red markings around their head. The platform plummeted downward after Ayre. I was able to save myself through the quick application of Flight, which I had prepared for this very eventuality, but Ayre was beyond saving. She fell for so, so long. Perhaps she is still falling. I cannot find her.</p>
            <p>I do not know if I am able to continue the planned research. Many of the ideas laid out back at the Institute (by people, I must point out, who did not even consider the possibility of embarking on the journey themselves) seem utterly laughable in the face of the Edge itself. Using trained pack spiders to mount an expedition downward … pure rubbish! We did not realize the sheer scale of the Edge.</p>
            <p>I have no doubt that further attempts will be made to exploit the Core. I will not be part of them.</p>
