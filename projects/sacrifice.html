            <p>The Soft-Skinned Sacrifice grew up poor, in the depths of Aslesh’s great canyon-city. She was six years old when she first saw the sun. It was one of the Clay Church’s high holy days, a great festival, and her parents brought her up to see the surface, to look at all of the people dressed up in their finest cloths and flaunting their changes. At the end of the festival, as the sun began to drop below the edge of the warped hills, she watched a sacrifice draw magic into himself. The bright glow of unfocused magic seared into her eyes as she watched him change.</p>
            <p>Her family were devout followers of the Clay Church’s god, but never had enough money or social capital to afford to be changed. She knew of the warped, of course. Sometimes she saw them from a distance. Her great-grandfather had been warped, but the changes had not bred true. Perhaps it was that which began her family’s decline, or perhaps it was something else. The truth of the matter is not important. What is important is that her mother was ambitious and uncaring. So she was raised for a purpose.
            She sold herself the day she came of age. The money - and oh, what money it was - went to her family, and she went into service. Her first owner was a Rough-Voiced Merchant, stopping off in Aslesh as part of a long, looping trade route that took him to what seemed like every corner of the Reach. He was not a cruel owner, as these things go, better by far than if she had been bought by someone like her mother. She cooked, mended, and warmed his bed. Sometimes she warmed the beds of other members of his caravan. She felt little for any of them, save for the one warped guard.</p>
            <p>The Warped Guard’s skin was cool and stony, and her head and back were covered with dozens of flowering vines, all perfectly formed of polished granite. She was a gentle lover, more interested in warmth and comfort than others the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice was lent to. Being held and kissed by one of the warped was near a religious experience, and for a time the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice thought that she was in love.</p>
            <p>But these things never last. Fortune had not favored the Rough-Voiced Merchant, and he was desperately scrambling to scrape together enough money to keep his caravan afloat. In Intersection, dazzled by the city that seemed almost like a vast sculpture honoring her gods, the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice barely noticed the Warped Guard leaving the rough-voiced merchant’s caravan, or when she was sold to an Outcast Leptiniae.</p>
            <p>The Outcast Leptiniae was a cruel and mercurial mistress. Her moods shifted with the flow of magic. One day she would lavish praise upon the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice and bury her head in her thin fluff, the next she would barely be able to bring herself to look at her property, or would cruelly use her. The Soft-Skinned Sacrifice learned how to cry herself to sleep without making a sound, and hoped that they money she had brought to her family was enough to make it all worthwhile. Sometimes she dreamed that her family’s fortunes had soared and that they were going to buy her freedom.</p>
            <p>After a few months in Intersection, the Outcast Leptiniae and the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice joined a caravan traveling across the Reach. The Outcast Leptiniae spoke of seeking work in Rilgate, and the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice smiled and nodded. It is hard to say whether things grew better or worse at this point. As they traveled away from the thick cloud of magic that blankets the Edge, the Outcast Leptiniae’s moods grew darker. She spent days sunk into a miasma of self-loathing, lashing out at anyone who ventured too close. Sometimes she would vanish from camp for a few hours and come back manic, wrapped in wisps of wild magic, the dark chitin that covered her body flushed with strange colors. The Soft-Skinned Sacrifice loved these times, loved being so close to the magic that she had been raised to worship, and then hated herself as she bandaged the wounds that the Outcast Leptiniae left on her body.</p>
            <p>The Outcast Leptiniae’s path danced along the outskirts of Aslesh, occasionally passing through small farming communities eking out a living between the Reach’s grasslands and Aslesh’s arid prairies. In one of these villages, in a bout of unusually deep depression, the Outcast Leptiniae sold the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice for a pittance. Her new owner, the Devout Trader, had hot rough skin wrapped in bands of almost-molten rock, at once so like and so unlike the Warped Guard. The Soft-Skinned Sacrifice could not touch them without burning herself, and after the first time she tried to slip into her new owner’s bed the Devout Trader gave her a salve to rub into her skin and explained that she had a different purpose. The Soft-Skinned Sacrifice was to be given to the Clay Church.</p>
            <p>The next weeks passed in a haze, but soon enough the Devout Trader and the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice were returning to Aslesh’s capital, buried in the depths of the warped hills’ canyons. It was a bittersweet, unfamiliar homecoming. She smelled familiar smells, saw people and places that almost matched her memories, heard cries and shouts that almost reminded her of her childhood. But Aslesh is a country built upon change, and the Devout Trader kept them to the upper levels of the city, far above the squalor she had grown up in. Nothing was quite the same as she had left it.</p>
            <p>Finally they arrived at one of the Clay Church’s edifices, a towering edifice of natural rock covered with carvings of the Warped and of the changes wrought by wild magic. It stood in a gap in the canyon-city’s dense structure, connected only be a handful of scattered bridges. They crossed a bridge of frozen fire that glittered in the light of the falling sun, and soon the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice was inside. The Devout Trader was known here, and as they quietly spoke to an attendant the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice looked around, almost disappointed by the smooth rock that was the only ornamentation inside the building.</p>
            <p>Soon enough the Devout Trader left, and the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice was led deeper into the building. The attendant left her with an elderly matron, who gave her new clothing and a bed in a long dormitory. Serving the Clay Church was not what the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice had expected. It was drudgery and routine, cleaning and cooking, falling back into bed utterly drained at the end of each day. Her breaks, such as they were, were filled with different kinds of work. Listening to priests lecturing about doctrine, watching other workers demonstrate new techniques, and, on all-too-rare occasions, eagerly rushing to watch a priest invoke magic to change part of the building. There was little time or space for love, perhaps a few stolen kisses or precious minutes filled with quiet gasps and tangled sheets, but the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice made do. Some of the other servants were warped, and they had always had a special place in her heart.</p>
            <p>Years rolled by in a comfortable routine. Occasionally the Devout Trader would look in on her, and occasionally the patterns of her days would shift, but she barely noticed either of these. Sometimes she thought about making inquiries into her family’s fate, but she could never quite find the time or inclination. She did not try very hard.</p>
            <p>Eventually a sudden shift in routine broke the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice out of the haze in which she had been living. Drudgery slipped away and was replaced with focused instruction, lectures about doctrine gave way to lessons about invoked magic. Her small cohort of unwarped humans learned how to gather magic to themselves, how to safely release it, and - in theory, not in practice - how to unsafely release it, channeling it back into their own bodies to dance and frolic and change.  Outside the lessons, they learned about the effects that magic has on those who touch it as they played and fucked and lost time, their minds fizzy and full of aimless energy.</p>
            <p>The realization of what they were being trained for was gradual. Some of them began to suspect it as soon as their instruction began, while others only realized after their instruction turned to rituals. They shared this knowledge in gossip and whispers, none of them wanting to commit to it until they were sure. By the time they were explicitly told, nearly half of their number had failed in one way or another and been moved elsewhere, back into the routine of the servants or into training for other purposes.</p>
            <p>It was half a moon before the celebration of the Breaking. They were led into a wide and airy room high in the tower, and pressed close to its walls as the Changing Priest entered. He was wrapped in magic, his form obscured, as it always is. He told them that they were to be sacrifices to Change, three on each of the days of the celebration, their order and the time of their sacrifice chosen by chance and luck. Then he left.</p>
            <p>None of them slept that night. Some of them were kept awake by excitement, vibrating with energy, and some were busy trying to engineer an escape. The Clay Church had tried to choose them carefully, but mistakes can be made. The next day two of them were gone, and another three disappeared before the celebration. The Soft-Skinned Sacrifice did not hear what fate they would endure if they were found and captured, nor did she ever hear whether they were. They didn’t matter. They were unfaithful cowards.</p>
            <p>The weeks until the festival were spent in frantic preparation, making sure that they all knew their role, that none of them would falter or fail. They practiced, they rehearsed, they did far more than their relatively simple roles would require. Eventually, just a few days before the celebration itself, they were told which order they would be sacrificed in. The Soft-Skinned Sacrifice was not the first, nor the last. Her place was near the middle of the celebration, during what was usually a lull. The crowds would be a bit thinner, only the truly faithful and those who couldn’t make it to the earlier days. She smiled when she heard this.</p>
            <p>She hardly slept the night before her sacrifice. In the early afternoon attendants prepared her body, rubbing her with scented oils and sculpting her hair into shapes which mirrored the ones the last sacrifice had left on the ground. Beyond that there was nothing. She was naked, with nothing except her hair to distract from what would happen to her body. She spent what seemed like an eternity waiting in an antechamber, pacing and trying to relax, trying to make time go faster, rehearsing what she would need to do.</p>
            <p>In the end, the Soft-Skinned Sacrifice stepped out onto the dry, cracked surface of the warped hills, emerging from a cunningly hidden passageway. She walked forward, sweat beading on her body, and stood at the center of the patterns carved by generations of magic. As the sun kissed the horizon she gathered magic into herself, and as the last light began to flee the sky she became something else.</p>
