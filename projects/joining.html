            <strong>To Join a Dragon</strong> - in which you, the reader, have made a very bad choice indeed. Set in the world of Broken Shell. Not quite 600 words.<br/><strong>Trigger Warnings:</strong> mention of slavery and torture, implied abuse, verbal abuse, worrying implications.

            <p>The crate shakes as it’s unloaded from a boat. After all this time it’s getting decidedly lived-in. You weren’t expecting this when you signed up - surely they treat volunteers better? - but it’s too late to turn back now. You can hear hoarse cries of pain from the other crates, so at least it seems like they’re being a bit more careful about moving you than the other recruits.</p>
            <p>There is a long pause. Finally you hear a voice outside.</p>
            <p>“This the volunteer?” Another pause. “Huh. First one of those in a long time. Well, better get them out.”</p>
            <p>The side of the crate creaks as it’s pried away, leaving you to stumble out into the bright sunlight. It takes a few moments for your eyes to adjust, and when you do the first thing you see is a burly man with scarred and melted skin.</p>
            <p>“Human. Well, we’ll fix that,” he says. His eyes are dull, and his smile is reflected by the dozens of mouths which glimmer in his scars for a fleeting moment.</p>
            <p>“W-what happens now?”, you croak, your throat hoarse from dehydration.</p>
            <p>“Follow,” he says, turning away from you. “We will prepare you for service.”</p>
            <p>He walks away and you follow. You won’t remember most of it afterward, but at the time it seems overwhelming, struggling to convince your legs to cooperate, struggling to keep up, struggling to take in as much of the docks as you can. You see creatures with fine iridescent scales covering gaping wounds, with thousands of fine hair-like tentacles waving hungrily in the breeze, with bodies made of crystal or eyeballs or nothingness. The only normal people you see are your fellows from the boat, now chained and weeping as they are led down a ramp towards the depths of Culdreth’s island.</p>
            <p>Finally you reach its center, a massive borehole drilling down through the world’s flesh. It is surrounded by towers, sharp geometric shapes rising as high as your weary eyes can see. The shadow of a flying creature passes over you as you pause at the entrance of one of the towers, and you shiver in the sudden chill.</p>
            <p>Your guide turns to look at you, and says, “Drink what you are given.” He pushes the door open and gestures for you to enter. You do, of course, what other choice do you have now? The door closes behind you.</p>
            <p>The inside of the tower is surprisingly warm and homey. A fire crackles in the hearth, the scent of sweet herbs and spices fills the air, and the sun seems somehow more pleasant where it shines in through many small windows. As you enter, a vaguely reptilian woman is pouring a fresh cup of tea. She glances at you, and gestures to a chair as she pours a cup for you. It is the first thing you have been given to drink in almost a day, and you gulp it down eagerly, feeling suddenly reinvigorated as the warm liquid reaches your stomach.</p>
            <p>You will not remember what you talk about with her. Only that it is pleasant and relaxing, enjoyable, carefree. In times to come you will treasure these moments. She even smiles at you. But then … you make a mistake. You always do, eventually. It’s who you are. It’s what you are. She frowns at you.</p>
            <p>You wake in utter darkness, your skin numb and insensate.</p>
            <p>There is nothing else. You will be here for a long, long time.</p>
